`MyLabsStocks` offers Python API and R package allowing to perform 
quantitative analysis of nucleosomal epigenome. It is especially well 
suited for scripting to extract natural Single-Nucleosome Epi-
Polymorphisms (SNEP) from ChIP-Seq data.

Usage
=====

In the strain section, the form `Search in genotype` filters strains where the 
fields `locus1`, `locus2`, `locus3`, `locus4`, `locus5`, `ADE2`, `HIS3`, `LEU2`, 
`LYS2`, `MET15`, `TRP1`, `URA3`, `HO_`, `Cytoplasmic_Character` or 
`extrachromosomal_plasmid` contain the given expression. This filter is case 
insensitive.
